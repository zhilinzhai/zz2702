Hello this is my HUDK 4050 Core Methods in Education Data Mining portfolio 

In this portfolio you can see the projects including: 

4050 ACA Project 

4050 ICE project

4050 EDM project Final paper

4050 Reflection Paper

I have learned numerous useful knowledge on data mining this semester. At the beginning, I learned how to deal with the tidy data. From the ACA 1, we filtered nearly 4000 data from the data set. Then, I learned how to do the data prediction by using the linear regression model, logistic regression model, classification model and Naïve Bayes model through Python programming. In the ACA2, we built the classifier for off-task behavior in classroom by using the machine learning. Then, I also learn the knowledge of clustering and how to make the k-mean clustering. In the ACA 3, we use cluster to identify the similar colleges and universities. I also learned how to compress the data by using PCA model. That’s one of the most interesting parts for me, since I never consider data also have different dimension. In the end of the semester, I also learned how to create the social network analysis. Due to the social network analysis, we can analyze the centrality and different relationship between each factor. The social network analysis is my favorite part. Since we can build the data set with our group members and find out the interesting correlation between each other through Python programming.
